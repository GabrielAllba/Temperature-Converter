## Project Prompt

Now that we’ve learned about the basics of variables and cin, let’s write a program!

The mad scientist Kelvin has mastered predicting the weather in his mountain-side meteorology lab.

Recently, Kelvin began publishing his weather forecasts on his website, however, there’s a problem: All of his forecasts describe the temperature in Fahrenheit degrees.

Let’s convert a temperature from Fahrenheit (F) to Celsius (C).

The formula is the following: C = (F - 32) / 1.8

## Technologies

- C++

## Setup

Generally, you would want to compile and execute the program locally. To do that:

1. Download `temperature.cpp`.
2. Open command line interface and navigate to the directory where the files are downloaded.
3. Run the following commands to compile and execute the program:

```git
g++ temperature.cpp -o temperature
./temperature
```
